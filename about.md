# About

<p style="text-align: justify">
I am Joe Subbiani. I am a game developer at Climax Studios.
I started this site after completing my final year dissertation at the University of Glasgow on the visualisation of four dimensional geometry, and this evolved into the project <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2264190/4D_Games/">4D Games</a>, available on Steam.
